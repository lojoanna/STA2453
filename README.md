# Predicting Gene Expression from Neighbouring Cells

## Overview

This repository contains code for an independent research project analyzing spatial transcriptomics data from the **Vizgen MERSCOPE Mouse Brain Map**. The study investigates **spatial patterns of gene expression**, **cell-neighbor relationships**, and **co-expression networks** across multiple mouse brain slices.

The project applies **preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling** to understand how spatial organization influences gene expression. The analysis leverages high-resolution spatial transcriptomic data, where individual cells' gene expression profiles are mapped to their physical locations.

## Data Source

The raw datasets are publicly available from **Vizgen's Mouse Brain Map**. Due to file size limitations, the data files are not included in this repository, but they can be accessed at:

ðŸ“Œ [Vizgen Mouse Brain Map](https://info.vizgen.com/mouse-brain-map)

To reproduce the analysis, download the dataset and update the **file paths** in `01_data_loading.R`.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into modular scripts to ensure reproducibility and organization:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ 00_setup.R                 # Loads libraries and sets global options
â”œâ”€â”€ 01_data_loading.R          # Retrieves file paths and loads datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ 02_analysis_functions.R    # Defines custom functions for analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ 03_preprocessing.R         # Performs data cleaning and transformations
â”œâ”€â”€ 04_exploratory_analysis.R  # Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA)
â”œâ”€â”€ 05_statistical_analysis.R  # (Upcoming) Statistical modeling & evaluation
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # Project documentation
```

### **Description of Scripts**
- **`00_setup.R`** â†’ Loads required libraries and sets global options.
- **`01_data_loading.R`** â†’ Extracts file paths and loads gene expression & metadata.
- **`02_analysis_functions.R`** â†’ Stores reusable functions for coordinate transformation, visualization, and analysis.
- **`03_preprocessing.R`** â†’ Cleans data by removing low-quality cells and normalizing spatial coordinates.
- **`04_exploratory_analysis.R`** â†’ Visualizes mRNA count distributions, cell volume, gene-gene co-expression, and spatial relationships.
- **`05_statistical_analysis.R`** *(coming soon)* â†’ Will contain statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and evaluation metrics.

## Reproducibility

To run the analysis:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spatial-transcriptomics.git
   cd spatial-transcriptomics
   ```
2. Install the required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "data.table", "Matrix", "Rfast", "matrixStats", 
                   "ggridges", "reticulate", "anndata", "ComplexHeatmap", "lmtest"))
   ```
4. Download the dataset from Vizgen Mouse Brain Map and place the files in your local directory.
5. Run the scripts in order:
   ```r
   source("00_setup.R")
   source("01_data_loading.R")
   source("02_analysis_functions.R")
   source("03_preprocessing.R")
   source("04_exploratory_analysis.R")
   source("05_statistical_analysis.R")  # Once available
   ```
